# thermostat_arduino_lcd_display
Sketch for an arduino (tested on and works on an uno) that is a thermostat with display to power on/off a refrigeration unit lacking integrated temperature controls. Uses an arduino, a lcd display, a relay board, two potentiometers (one for changing the set temperature and one for dimming the display), and a BMP180 temperature/pressure module for sensor feedback.
